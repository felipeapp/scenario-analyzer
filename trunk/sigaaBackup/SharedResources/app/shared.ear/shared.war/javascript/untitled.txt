Hi, folks! 

What would be a good practice when dealing with domain object rules which depend on parameters in a database? For example: a Student is attending a Course and I want to set his final grade. When I set the grade, I should also set the attendance status, i.e. if the student was approved or not. (Is attendance a correct name for the relationship between Student and Course? I'm not a native English speaker.)

class Attendance {

	Student student;
	
	Course course;
	
	Double grade;
	
	AttendanceStatus status;
	
	void setGrade(Double grade) {
		this.grade = grade;
		if (grade >= MINIMUM_GRADE) // MINIMUM_GRADE should be a parameter from DB
			this.status = AttendanceStatus.APPROVED;
		else
			this.status = AttendanceStatus.FAILED;
	}

} 

How should I retrieve that MININUM_GRADE from the Database?

Sorry if this was already discussed in previous threads.

David.
