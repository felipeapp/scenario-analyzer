Research survey on the evolution of Netty

Hi Jeff Beck (beckje01),

We are a group of researchers based out of UFRN in Brazil (http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/en/), and we are developing tool support for the automatic detection of execution time variations and their causes in terms of methods, commits and issues.

We have applied our tool to analyze the evolution of the Netty framework and we present partial results of this analysis in the survey. It would be great if you could help us by answering the survey questions:

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Felipe Pinto
