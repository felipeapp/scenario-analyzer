Research survey on the evolution of Jetty

Hi Hugues Malphettes (hmalphettes),

We are a group of researchers based out of UFRN in Brazil (http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/en/), and we are developing an open-source tool for the automatic detection of execution time (response time) variations and their causes in terms of methods, commits and development issues. The tool source code is available at Google Code, but it is still a work in progress and part of the code may be unstable:
https://code.google.com/p/scenario-analyzer/source/checkout

We have applied our tool to analyze the evolution of the Jetty framework (servlet project in releases 9.2.6, 9.2.7, 9.2.8, 9.2.9, 9.2.10, 9.3.0.M0, 9.3.0.M1) and we present partial results of this analysis in the survey.

It would be great if you could help us by answering the survey questions:

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Felipe Pinto
